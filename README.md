# My projects

- Shiny_App : Shiny application in R which analyses levels of degradation for reliable products, in order to use it open the Shiny_app.Rproj file in RStudio and play "Run App"  
- ConnectFour : Old project of a Connect Four game in Python that can be played solo or in duo. You need the pygame library in order to work. You can lauch the "Puissance4DuoGraphique.py" file to play in duo or the "modeMonoJoueur.py" to play solo. The solo mode is in French though.
